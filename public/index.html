                Automatically switches over to Inverter when power supply is coming over Backup/DG. It switches back automatically to the mains as soon as Normal electricity supply is resumed. This saves from the high cost of Backup charges. The Inverter gets charged only over Mains and not over DG/Backup. If Inverter gets discharged/Overloaded, the supply is automatically switched onto DG for 60 minutes till Inverter gets charged again.
